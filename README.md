Welcome to the Voting Machine, where you can select your candidate from the "right" or "wrong" party. 

Purpose:
To capture votes to a database through voters voting for candidates.

How it works:
1. A voter is prompted to input their full name
2. Assuming the voter has given the correct name, the voter is given a menu
3. The menu has three options;
	1. List of Candidates
		- prints a list of candidates
	2. Check your registered party
		- prints that user's affiliated party
	3. Vote now!
		- user places a vote!
4. The end!


enjoy :)
